First Project for CS 1080

I made a themed website that has information about the Anime series Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
I have a home page with an "About JJBA" section which includes a description of the overall series and a "Parts" section which has the cover art for all 6 released parts. 
The home page has a navbar which links back to the home page as well as a page for Part II and a page for Part IV of the series. 
You can also get to the other pages in the "Parts" section of the home page where there is a link under the corresponding cover art.

My Part II page has the theme song embedded as well as a plot summary. Then there's a section which displays the main characters and a section that has a picture of my cosplay of the main character of Part II.

My Part IV page has some of the same aspects. It has the theme song embedded as well as a plot summary as well as a main character section. Then there's a Stand Stats table which displays the main characters' stand stats.
